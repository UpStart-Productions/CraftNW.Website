        <!-- Waterfall -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/waterfall.jpg" alt="Waterfall" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />
          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Waterfall</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed">
              Good luck! The player that lands on this space is the one to initiate The Waterfall. Once they start drinking everyone else in the group must promptly begin to drink as well. Players cannot stop drinking until it is their turn. The initiating player stops first, then the player to their left, then the player to that player's left, so on and so forth.
            </p>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed mt-3">
              So, the person to the initiating players right should be drinking for the longest amount of time as they cannot stop drinking until everyone else does.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Thumb Master -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/thumb-master.jpg" alt="Thumb Master" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />
          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Thumb Master</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed">
              The player who lands on this space wields the power of the Thumb Master until someone else in the game lands on a Thumb Master space. This means that at any time, at their discretion, they can put their thumb on the table and the last player to notice and also put their thumb on the table loses and has a penalty drink.
            </p>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed mt-3">
              This can be used as many times as the individual wants while they wield the power, but should be done discreetly...in other words, players who notice should also be discrete and not announce it to the group.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- 7 Heaven -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/7-heaven.jpg" alt="7 Heaven" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />

            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">7 Heaven</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed">
              This space is a bit like Thumb Master. However, the person who lands on this space may only use its power once, and it must be before their next turn. When they point their finger to the sky, the last player to also point their finger skyward must drink.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Drive -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/drive.jpg" alt="Drive" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />
          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Drive</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed">
              A player that lands on this space Initiates the Drive game once. All players must pretend they are gripping a steering wheel with both thumbs pointed up. The Initiating player says VROOM and points both thumbs either left or right. The player toward whom the thumbs are pointed must then say either VROOM (thumbs pointed the same direction toward the next player) or a SKIRRRRT (thumbs pointed the opposite direction to the proceeding player). If a player messes up or hesitates, they take a drink.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Hot Seat -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/hot-seat.jpg" alt="Hot Seat" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />
          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Hot Seat</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed">
              This one can be fun! The player that lands on this space can chose any other player to put In the Hot Seat and ask 1 question. Any question Is fair game for the player In the Hot Seat no matter how embarrassing, personal, or ridiculous. A satisfactory answer Is determined solely by the player that landed on the Hot Seat space. An unsatisfactory answer means the player In the Hot Seat must drink.
            </p>

        <!-- Little Green Man -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/little-green-man.jpg" alt="Little Green Man" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />
          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Play Little Green Man</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed">
              This one Is simple, but easy to forget. The player that lands on this space must, for the duration of the game, pretend that a Little Green Man Is sitting on the rim of their drink. So, of course, whenever that player takes a drink, they must first remove the Little Green Man, take a drink, then gently return the Little Green Man to his rightful place on the rim of their drink.
            </p>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed mt-3">
              If the player, goodness forbid, forgets to remove or replace the Little Green Man, they must take an additional drink....removing and replacing the Little Green Man.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Make a Rule -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/make-a-rule.jpg" alt="Make a Rule" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />
          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Make a Rule</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-3">
              The player who lands on this space gets to make up their own rule, which all players (including themselves) must follow until someone else in the group lands on one of these spaces and makes a new rule. Some examples are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-craft-charcoal">
              <li>All players must speak in an accent</li>
              <li>You cannot refer to anyone by their name</li>
              <li>No curse words allowed</li>
              <li>Everyone must drink only with their non dominant hand</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed mt-3">
              The penalty for breaking the rule is typically 1 drink but your group may make alterations as desired.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Monkey Drink -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/monkey-drink.jpg" alt="Monkey Drink" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />
          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Monkey Drink</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed">
              This one Is brutal! In order to complete the "monkey drink" the player who lands on this space must do a handstand (against a wall is recommended) and someone else in the group pours the players drink into their mouth while they are in the upside down position. Try not to get it in their nose and have fun!
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Pick a Mate -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/pick-a-mate.jpg" alt="Pick a Mate" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />
          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Pick a Mate</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed">
              The player (player 1) who lands on this space gets to choose one other player to be their "mate" (player 2). This means that every time player 1 has to drink in the game, so does player 2, and vice versa. This mateship lasts until someone else lands on the mate space. There should not be more than one mated couple at any time during the game.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Play a Game -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/play-a-game.jpg" alt="Play a Game" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />
          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Play a Game</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-3">
              It's wise to approach Tipsy Trails with a game or two In mind as opposed to thinking up something on the spot. It just keeps the whole thing moving along faster. Whoever lands on this space gets to dictate a mini game-within-a-game to the rest of the group that must be played to Its conclusion before the next player can roll the dice.
            </p>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Some examples of good games are:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-craft-charcoal text-sm">
              <li><strong>Categories:</strong> player selects a category (let's say Craft Beers from the Pacific Northwest) and all players must, In turn, accurately say something from the chosen category.</li>
              <li><strong>Rhyme:</strong> player starts with a word or phrase and all other players must say a word or phrase that rhymes.</li>
              <li><strong>Tic-Tac-Toe:</strong> player selects 2 people to play tic-tac-toe In under 10 seconds.</li>
              <li><strong>Capitals:</strong> each player must name a different state capital.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed mt-3">
              Of course, whomever fails at any game must take at least 1 drink. However, It's up to the player that lands on this space to dictate the number of penalty drinks.
            </p>

        <!-- Give $5 to Charity -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">
          <img src="/images/products/tipsy-trails/give-charity.jpg" alt="Give $5 to Charity" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover" />
          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Give $5 to Charity</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed">
              If a player lands on this space, they have until their next turn to donate $5 to a charity of their choice. If the player cannot show a receipt for a $5 donation by their next turn, they must take a shot.
            </p>
          </div>

        <!-- Play Your Song -->
        <div class="card overflow-hidden">

          <div class="p-6">
            <h3 class="text-craft-black mb-3">Play Your Song</h3>
            <p class="text-craft-charcoal leading-relaxed">
              A player that lands on this space must play 30 seconds of their current favorite song and then take a vote of all players. If the majority of players dislike the song, the player must drink.
